Hey all,
You can call me Buck. While I'm not new to using linux based OS, I am very new to the idea of getting my hands dirty with programing, or digging about in the OS.
I plan to learn Linux better (RedHat, Debian and Arch), and learn Python, so I can be better able to make my own project ideas come to life.

I love to mess around with Raspberry Pi's. I'm currently distro hopping on the little thing, but I realize there is a lack of support on any un-official OS.
I got a CM4 and a Waveshare IO board that I'm trying to figure out I2C controls for PWM fans.

There is a long road ahead of me. If I ask stupid questions, my appologies. Some times things are not so clear to me as they might be to others.
